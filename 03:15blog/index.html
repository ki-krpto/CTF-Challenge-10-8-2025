<p class="lead">A fragmented journal page recovered from a broken link. Review the artifacts closely. Everything is a clue.</p>

<h2>Journal Entry — Fragment 10.13</h2>
<p>I keep hearing frequencies in the walls—it's like white noise, but with numbers. The time is wrong; the clock keeps resetting. I tried to correct the time to the designated date, but it snaps back to a constant state. I can't trust my memory of the dates anymore.</p>

<!-- Artifact #1: Planner Photograph -->
<div class="note">
<strong>Artifact #1: Planner Photograph</strong><br>
A photo of a personal planner. One day is circled, but the ink smudge is deliberate.<br>
<em>Hint: Check the reflection in the monitor and the lower-right corner near the clock. Numbers might not be dates—they could be coordinates or a cipher.</em>

<!-- Artifact #2: Encrypted Voice Log -->
<div class="note">
<strong>Artifact #2: Encrypted Voice Log</strong><br>
A short distorted voice note labeled “self-reminder.”<br>
<em>Hint: The waveform might hide a pattern—peaks could represent binary, Morse, or a Caesar key. The noise floor itself may be the message.</em>
