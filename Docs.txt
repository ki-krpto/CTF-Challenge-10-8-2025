Title: POV — "Marissa's Last Notes"
Duration target: 40–60 seconds
Style: first-person POV (no faces). Handheld phone camera, natural lighting, subtle unease. Keep takes short and quiet. Whisper audio must be soft and partly buried in ambient noise.
Props: desk calendar (10/2022 with 13 circled), analog clock (set to 10:13 or an impossible time like 25:13 using paper overlay), sticky note with short URL or QR, notebook with faint scribble "10/13", small lamp for side lighting, plain background.

SHOT LIST & DIRECTIONS

1) OPEN - ESTABLISH (3–6s)
- Camera: POV looking down at desk from approximately chest height.
- Action: slow 2–3 second push-in toward desk. Let camera stabilize on the clock area.
- Audio: low ambient hum (room), faint far-off traffic or fridge hum. No dialogue.
- Purpose: frame the environment and the impossible clock.

2) CLOCK FOCUS (3–5s)
- Camera: gentle pan to the analog clock on the desk. Hold for 2–3 seconds.
- Direction: linger so viewers can read the time. Time must be clearly legible (10:13) or obviously impossible (25:13).
- Audio: a near-silent tick; almost imperceptible whisper under the hum saying: (very soft) "ten…"

3) STICKY NOTE / URL (4–6s)
- Camera: pan right to a small sticky note near the clock (do not show face). Slowly zoom to reveal a short URL or QR printed on the note.
- Action: hold long enough to allow players to pause the video and read it. The URL should be simple: e.g., `marissa-archive.github.io/blog/` or a short path like `/blog/` displayed clearly.
- Audio: whisper continues, layered: "thirteen…" (soft, breathy)

4) CALENDAR / NOTE (4–7s)
- Camera: tilt down to show a corner of the calendar (10/2022). The 13 is circled but slightly smudged. Also show a partially visible notebook page with the scribble "10/13".
- Direction: camera should intentionally not be perfectly steady — subtle hand movement creates realism.
- Audio: faint paper shuffle; whisper: "twenty-two…" (very soft, staccato)

5) ROOM PAN / SUBTLE ANOMALY (6–10s)
- Camera: slow pan left across the desk to show a lamp and a faint reflection in a dark window. In the reflection, you might glimpse a shelf or object that is slightly misaligned compared to the foreground (this is optional).
- Direction: include a small intentional continuity error — e.g., a book placed differently in the reflection vs foreground — to create a sense that reality is unstable.
- Audio: faint nonverbal noise (distant creak). Whisper under the noise: a breathy phrase: "remember…"

6) FINAL GLANCE & LINE (8–12s)
- Camera: move back toward the center of the desk; frame the clock, sticky, and calendar in a single shot. Slight handheld sway as if the person is tired.
- Action: a hand (briefly visible) reaches into frame to adjust a pen or move a paper but is cut off before the wrist — no face.
- Audio: clear-but-quiet whispered phrase delivered by the recording: "Find the day she stopped." Then, almost immediately: "ten… thirteen… two thousand twenty-two." (whispered, quiet but audible if headphones are used)
- End: small camera dip (simulating exhaustion), then the video ends.

NOTES ON WHISPER MIXING
- Whisper lines must be mixed at low volume, partially masked with room ambience so players have to listen closely or use headphones.
- Exact whispered lines (to record and layer quietly):
  1. "ten…"
  2. "thirteen…"
  3. "twenty-two…"
  4. "remember…"
  5. Final: "Find the day she stopped." then, immediately: "ten… thirteen… two thousand twenty-two."

SFX TIPS
- Use real ambient room recordings (fan, fridge hum) and keep them low. Avoid music.
- Add a soft low-frequency rumble (subtle) under the whole track to increase unease.

FILMING TIPS
- Shoot in 1080p at 30fps on a phone. Use the phone's native camera app to keep the authentic look.
- Keep lighting natural. Use a desk lamp at low intensity behind the camera to create soft side light.
- Film multiple takes of each shot with slight variations in pacing so you can edit for the right reveal timing.
- When showing the URL/QR, ensure it's legible in the frame and not obstructed.

EXPORT & EDIT
- Keep the full video under 60 seconds for the `insta_pov.mp4` file.
- Edit whispers to be slightly overlapping with the ambient audio so they are not obvious on first listen.
- Ensure the final whispered line is the clearest whisper in the mix, just under conversational volume.


# /docs/judging_rubric.txt

Google Form fields (copy/paste into a new Google Form):
1. Team name (Short answer) — "What is your team's name?"
2. Final answer (Short answer) — "Date of disappearance (MM/DD/YYYY or Month Day, Year)"
3. Evidence (Paragraph) — "Briefly describe the evidence that led you to this date (one-two sentences). Include which clue(s) you used: insta clip / blog image / audio / archive post."
4. Screenshot upload (File upload - optional) — "Attach a screenshot showing one clue you used (optional)."
5. Time submitted (auto-timestamped by Google Forms)

Judging rubric (for organizers) — quick checklist per submission:
- Correct date? (Exact match or acceptable format — e.g., 10/13/2022 or October 13, 2022)
- Evidence shows at least one primary clue was used (calendar image, audio whisper transcript, final archive excerpt)
- If name/date is correct but evidence weak or missing: award partial credit and request screenshot

Scoring (suggested):
- Full correct date + valid evidence: 100 points
- Correct date but weak/ambiguous evidence: 70 points (organizer discretion)
- Wrong date but correct path to archive (reached final page): 40 points
- Mini-credits:
  - Found blog URL (first link): 10 pts
  - Found/played blog audio: 15 pts
  - Reached archive page: 25 pts

Tiebreaker:
- Time of correct submission (earlier wins). If multiple correct teams in the same minute, use clarity of evidence (screenshots) as secondary tiebreak.

Ethics & verification note (organizer):
- This is fictional. Do not use or encourage real OSINT on live people.
- Verify screenshot timestamps (phone screenshots show time) if teams try to game the system.


# /docs/playtest_checklist.txt

Playtest checklist (before the event):
- [ ] Confirm `index.html`, `blog/index.html`, and `archive/index.html` are uploaded to the repo and render correctly on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Place `assets/insta_pov.mp4`, `assets/final.mp4`, `assets/calendar.jpg`, and `blog/audio.mp3` into the repo and confirm links are correct.
- [ ] Test audio playback on multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari) and on mobile phones.
- [ ] Verify QR / URL in the POV video points to the live blog path.
- [ ] Play the full flow from start to finish and time a single-solver run (aim 30–60 minutes).
- [ ] Test Google Form submissions and auto-timestamping.
- [ ] Prepare 3 hint cards/messages and ensure organizer knows when to release them.
- [ ] Backup: ZIP of the repo folder to share directly with teams if Pages has issues.

Hint wording & schedule (organizer-controlled):
- Hint 1 (15 minutes): "Pause the initial clip and look at the desk — some objects reveal dates when you zoom in." 
- Hint 2 (35 minutes): "Listen to the audio note on the blog — the numbers are whispered there." 
- Hint 3 (55 minutes): "If you're stuck, reopen the archive's final upload — the transcript contains the scheduled date." 

Playtesting notes (what to observe when you test):
- Are clues visible but not too obvious? (test by having someone unfamiliar try to solve)
- Does the audio whisper sit at the right volume (audible on headphones, subtle on laptop speakers)?
- Timing: do teams reach the final page in ~45–65 minutes during test runs?
- Are any clues accidentally discoverable by file inspection (if that's against your event rules)? If so, remove or obfuscate.
